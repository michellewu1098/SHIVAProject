Bugs:
[x] - Drill holes don't appear when totem is large
[x] - Params are not being deleted
[x] - Saving when empty totem causes crash

[ ] - Button repeat in profile XML has no effect - see System profile xml, final key mapping group

[ ] - Blending in symvol and totem is different
[ ] - Excessive rotation causes model to disappear off into distance
[ ] - Parameters need to work with multiple GLSLRenderers
[ ] - Dirty tree detection (when non-param values change, children change etc) automatically triggers rebuild, to save effort with remembering to rebuild shaders etc


Feature Requests:

[x] - Eye-gaze deflate needs to save settings
[x] - Basic instructions for Inkscape layering and screen blending
[x] - Description of Inkscape layering for button creation etc - email
[x] - Eye-gaze, dwell repeat - for next thurs default is not repeat
[x] - select above, select below buttons on rotate screen
[x] - Eye-gaze, rest cell disables / enables gaze
    - special events for enable/disable eye-gaze
    - rest cell then trigges this but ignores these events
    - In View's HandleEvent() include way for issuing a new event
[x] - Eye-gaze, dwell option for repeat (works globally)
[x] - Change all text to lower-case
[x] - Direct selection of objects on the pole.
[x] - Cuboid - show straight on i.e. not end first.
[x] - Drill and Slice screens - change camera angle to 1deg, make drill cylinder / etc appear in different place / longer
[x] - Default blending value to zero
[x] - When all objects are removed, remove all operations
[x] - New button removes all objects and operations


[x] - 'New' needs to reset the blending
[x] - GUI: ListView, add horizontal layout - put in eye-gaze profile
[x] - Uniform scale operation - make bigger, make smaller
[x] - Size of drill - adjustable buttons, make bigger and smaller
[x] - Add limits for scale
[x] - Edit Activity for nudge and swap - just clone assembly activity and remove creation buttons
[x] - Rest cell change colour to red when selected
[x] - Add transform node to root of tree just before exporting
      - DONE: hardcoded to 20x, can override in profile settings xml as "SaveRescaleSize"
      - include in profile scale value
      - Mark will work out how many units high the totem needs to be
      - next step is to set scale node to ensure totem is this height (can put in profile)
[x] - Nudge objects activity, blending is reset on enter - fix
[x] - Button on main screen to directly link to nudge activity
[x] - On 'tools' screen, second window doesn't get correct model colour
[x] - Nudge screen has nudges in all axes

[x] - Change the order of objects after they have been nudged
[x] - Adding an object will now always place it physically just on top of the top-most object (providing object is not scaled)
[x] - Full scaling, each axis
[x] - Rotate up/down
[x] - Indicator on cross-hairs for drill hole size



Mark: priority 1
[ ] - *** load vol files for totem, main.cpp allow any object type ***
[ ] - Shape library's scroll container, needs buttons for scrolling

[ ] - Make objects on totem above shuffle up / down as scale up / down
[ ] - Bounding box of blend increases depending on amount of blend (give a proper estimation - talk to Alexander)

Mark: Priority 2
[ ] - Some way to visualise bounding boxes for objects after blend that are otherwise hidden - make box wider according to blend amount
[ ] - Twist operation

Mark: priority 3
[ ] - Drill holes work per-object, repeat operation for all objects
[ ] - Undo button, all screens, clone tree
[ ] - Slice

[ ] - Buttons as optional (hidden) alternative to primitive list

Mouse input needs to go through a controller.
Desired behaviour:
[ ] - Press and hold -> choice to either click once, or repeat


Mark: Priority 10
[ ] - button to toggle on/off the pole

Operations:
 
[x] - Drill (straight through initially)
[x] - Rotate objects/shapes
[x] - Blend
[ ] - Stretch/squash object/shapes vertically and horizontally


[ ] - Eye gaze dwell to select object on totem, like the click. Low priority (can use buttons)
[ ] - Change scan and selection instruction to be one-way
[ ] - Add scan and selection instructions to layout XML
[ ] - Torus re-added.
[ ] - Load previously saved objects.
[ ] - Full-screen

[ ] - Document: prefs.xml

[ ] - Press button, lose window focus, press operation remains incomplete


SHIVA 2:
[ ] - Tapering - adjust scale at each end of object
[ ] - Screen for changing order of operations, swap them around

Profiles folder
---------------
22/08/2020 Mark Moseley has moved many of the profiles to a sub-folder called 'Other Profiles' so that they do not appear in the list of profiles.  This is so that for now, only the main touch, eye gaze and scanning profiles are available to keep things simpler.

To put them back, just move them back into the current folder.

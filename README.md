# SHIVA Project
## Sculpture for Health-care: Interaction and Virtual Art in 3D

The **SHIVA project** was designed to provide virtual sculpting tools for children with complex disabilities to allow them to engage with artistic and creative activities that they might otherwise never be able to access. Modern *3D printing* then allows us to physically build their creations. 

These tools were deployed in a school for students with complex disabilities and used for a variety of artistic, education and developmental purposes.

If cloning or downloading the project, be aware that we're including boost, consequently the download will be >4GB in size and therefore the all thing could take a long time.

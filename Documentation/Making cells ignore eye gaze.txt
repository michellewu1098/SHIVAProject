To make buttons visible, but not selectable by eye gaze (using profile .xml files)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the line:

	eyeGaze_enable="false"

to a button in e.g. C:\Users\SHIVA\Documents\GitHub\SHIVAProject\shiva-totem\vs\shiva-totem\Profiles\02 EyeGaze\totem1b\Layout\AssembleIOWithSymbols.xml

The button can still be selected by click/touch, but not by eye gaze.  This is useful for the 'New', 'Load' and 'Print/Export' buttons which may take the user to a non-eye gaze accessible dialogue or screen that they should not, or cannot access.


Cells that might have eye gaze disabled:
id="New"
id="Load"
id="PrintActivity"

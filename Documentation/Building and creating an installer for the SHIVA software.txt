Building and creating an installer for the SHIVA software
=========================================================

The project needs to be built as a 'Release version' otherwise an error about MSCVP100D.dll missing occurs.

The project needs to be packaged into an installer using NSIS.  There are NSIS scripts in:

SHIVAProject\shiva-totem\vs\shiva-totem


Once built there should be an installer in:

SHIVAProject\shiva-totem\vs\shiva-totem

called e.g. SHIVA_x64.exe


This needs to be copied into:

SHIVAProject\Installers


and then the project pushed to GitHub.
